# MCP Python Function Generator Server

An MCP server that exposes a tool to generate Python function code based on a description.

## Setup (Easy Install with uv)

This server is designed to be easy to set up using the `uv` Python package manager.

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have `uv` installed and available in your system's PATH. See [uv installation instructions](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
2.  **Get the Code:** Clone this repository or download and extract the source code ZIP file.
3.  **Run Setup Script:**
    *   **Windows:** Open Command Prompt or PowerShell, navigate (`cd`) to the project directory, and run: `.\setup.bat`
    *   **Linux/macOS:** Open your terminal, navigate (`cd`) to the project directory, make the script executable (`chmod +x setup.sh`), and run: `./setup.sh`
    The script will use `uv` to create a local virtual environment (`.venv`) and install the necessary dependencies.

4.  **Configure Your MCP Client:** The setup script will print the exact `command` ("uv") and `args` array you need. Copy these values into your MCP client's configuration file (e.g., Claude Desktop's settings JSON). The `args` will include `--cwd` followed by the absolute path to *your* project directory, ensuring `uv` can find the project regardless of where the client runs it from.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "pythonFunctionGenerator": {
          "command": "uv",
          "args": [ "run", "--cwd", "/path/to/your/project/MCP_Server", "mcp-function-generator" ] // <-- Generated by setup script
        }
        // Add other servers like filesystem if needed
      }
    }
    ```
    *(Remember that backslashes `\` in Windows paths might need to be escaped as `\\` in JSON strings)*

## Usage

Once configured in your client, the MCP server will be automatically started by the client (`uv run ...`) when needed. The client will communicate with it using STDIO.

The server exposes a tool named `create_python_function` that accepts the following required arguments:

## Development

If you want to modify the server:
1. Ensure you are in the project directory.
2. You can use `uv` commands directly (e.g., `uv run lint`, `uv python your_script.py`). `uv` will automatically use the `.venv` created during setup.
3. Changes you make to the `.py` files will be reflected the next time the server is run by the MCP client, because the setup used an *editable* install (`uv pip install -e .`).
